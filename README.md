# Party game
Objective: Have the most points by the end of 10 rounds

Player count: 5-10

# Gameplay
Each turn, one player is in the "hot seat".

The hot seat player draws a question, and then answer the question honestly.

All other players must answer the question as well in the attempt of impersonating the person in the hot seat.

Points are gained by correctly guessing which answer is the hot seat player's answer.


# Scoring

The player in the hot seat gains 3 points as long as one other player guesses their answer correctly. 

If everyone guesses correctly the hot seat player's answer, meaning their answer was too specific and obivous, then the player gets zero points. 

If the non-hot seat players get their answer chosen, they will get a point for it.
